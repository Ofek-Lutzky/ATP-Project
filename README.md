MAZE PROJECT:

  So i Built a Maze from scruch!
  
  First, i need to understand how to deal with the problem.
  So, i draw graph that show the different parts that the program will include, And how it will be connected.
  
  I undersand i need to divide to different steps of working on the code.
  The Steps:
      1. build the generator, the solver.(i a generic way)
      2. build server client architecture. (data tranfer of the maze and solver)
      3. build an App with javaFx in MVVM Archi with Css, that will combine all the parts together. 
  
  So, I used alot of design patterns and Kept on SOLID Code Built.
  
  Finally, I am really glad to finish and to show of the Application I made:
  
  Open Window:

  click On the Button!
  
  
  Game Window before Start:

  Choose the number of rows and columns and hit Play button.
  The Algo behind will connect to the server and will make a maze to play in.
  The java Fx will present all the scene.  
  
  When Hit Play:
  Show->![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101524820/179180923-f09504d8-ec68-468c-8684-5ff2d2b510e9.png)
  and there will start the game music.

  you can move with mouse or arrows or numpad, and even move in slants if affordable.

  Also can Save the maze and return in the future to start from the same place:

  Used PhotoShop and code to make all the scene accesories and the moves of the character:

  the window i also resizable and if you work on a really big maze you can scroll to see closer.
